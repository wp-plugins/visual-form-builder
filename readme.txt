== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins > Add New
1. Click the Upload link
1. Click Browse and locate the `visual-form-builder.x.x.zip` file
1. Click Install Now
1. After WordPress installs, click on the Activate Plugin link

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I build my form? =

1. Click on the New Form button and enter a few form details
1. Click the form fields from the box on the left to add it to your form.
1. Edit the information for each form field by clicking on the down arrow.
1. Drag and drop the elements to put them in order.
1. Click Save Form to save your changes.

= What's the deal with the fieldsets? =

Fieldsets, a way to group form fields, are an essential piece of this plugin's HTML. As such, at least one fieldset is required and must be first in the order. Subsequent fieldsets may be placed wherever you would like to start your next grouping of fields.

= Can I use my own verification system such as a CAPTCHA? =

Because of the accessibility and usability problems inherent with a CAPTCHA system, Visual Form Builder will not be using such a system. Other methods of SPAM prevention will be explored to further enhance protection of your forms.

= I'm not getting any emails! What's wrong? =

Some people have reported that after the form is submitted, no email is received.  If this is the case for you, it typically means that your server or web host has not properly configured their SMTP settings.

Try using a plugin such as [WP Mail SMTP](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) to correct the issue.

= Something in my theme isn't working anymore. What's wrong? =

Visual Form Builder is built using preferred WordPress coding standards. In many cases, some theme authors or plugin developers do not follow these standards and it causes conflicts with those that do follow the standards. The two most common issues have to do with either jQuery or CSS.

**jQuery conflicts**

Visual Form Builder requires at least jQuery version 1.7. Please make sure your theme is updated to use the latest version of jQuery.

**CSS conflicts**

If your forms do not look as expected, chances are there's some CSS in your theme conflicting with the built-in CSS of Visual Form Builder. Please follow the instructions on how to customize the CSS.

**Theme conflicts**

If you have confirmed that you are using the latest version of jQuery and can rule out CSS conflicts, there's probably something in your theme still causing problems.

1. Activate the default Twenty Eleven theme
1. Test your site to see if the issue still occurs

Still having problems even with Twenty Eleven running? If not, it's a conflict with your theme. Otherwise, it's probably a plugin conflict.

**Plugin conflicts**

Before following this process, make sure you have updated all plugins to their latest version (yes, even Visual Form Builder).

1. Deactivate ALL plugins
1. Activate Visual Form Builder
1. Test your site to see if the issue still occurs

If everything works with only Visual Form Builder activated, you have a plugin conflict. Re-activate the plugins one by one until you find the problematic plugin(s).

If, after following the above procedures, you are still having problems please report this issue on the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/visual-form-builder). 

= How do I customize the CSS? =

If you want to customize the appearance of the forms using your own CSS, here's how to do it:

1. Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file: `add_filter( 'visual-form-builder-css', '__return_false' );`
1. Copy everything from `css/visual-form-builder.css` into your theme's `style.css`
1. Change the CSS properties in your theme's `style.css` as needed

If you want to customize the jQuery date picker CSS, follow these steps:

1. Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file: `add_filter( 'vfb-date-picker-css', '__return_false' );`
1. Refer to the [jQuery UI Date Picker documentation on theming](http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#theming)

= How do I change the Date Picker configuration? =

The jQuery UI Date Picker is a complex and highly configurable plugin.  By default, Visual Form Builder's date field will use the default options and configuration.

To use the more complex features of the Date Picker plugin, [follow this tutorial](http://matthewmuro.com/2012/02/23/how-to-customize-the-date-picker/).

= How do I translate the field validation text to my language? =

The validation messages (ex: 'This field is required' or 'Please enter a valid email address') are generated by the jQuery Form Validation plugin.

By default, these messages are in English. To translate them, you must create a JavaScript file that contains your translations and insert it into your theme.

Follow these instructions:

In your theme folder, create a JavaScript file. In this example, I'm using `myjs.js`. Add the following code to it and customize the language to what you need:

`jQuery(document).ready(function($) { $.extend($.validator.messages, { required: "Eingabe nötig", email: "Bitte eine gültige E-Mail-Adresse eingeben" }); });`

Now, in your functions.php file, add the following piece of code:

`wp_enqueue_script( 'my-visual-form-builder-validation', get_bloginfo( 'template_url' ) . '/myjs.js' , array( 'jquery', 'jquery-form-validation' ), '', true );`

= How do I export my entries to a CSV? =

There are two ways to export your entries to a CSV: Export All or Export Selected.

To Export All:

1. Go to the Export screen
1. Select the form you would like to export and a date range, if needed
1. Click Download Export File and save the file

To Export Selected:

1. Go to the Entries screen
1. Check boxes next to the entries you wish to export
1. Select the `Export Selected` option under the `Bulk Actions` dropdown
1. Click Apply and save the file
